# Sonic-Skyline
A machine learning tool that identifies that horizon line in images and video and outputs it as an XY graph for musical sonification through MIDI. By listening to the shape of the horizon in a variety of environments, we can gain a greater appreciation of the beauty of our world and a chance to slow down and meditate on our environment.
